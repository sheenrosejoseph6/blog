  <p class="lead">Don't want your site or application to be scaled on different devices? With a little bit of work, you can disable the responsive features of this framework so that mobile users see your full desktop-version site.</p>

  <h3>Steps to disable responsive views</h3>
  <p>To disable responsive features, follow these steps. See it in action in the modified template below.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Remove (or just don't add) the viewport <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> mentioned in <a href="../css/#overview-mobile">the CSS docs</a></li>
    <li>Remove the <code>max-width</code> on the <code>.container</code> for all grid tiers with <code>max-width: none !important;</code> and set a regular width like <code>width: 970px;</code>. Be sure that this comes after the default Arrow framework CSS. You can optionally avoid the <code>!important</code> with media queries or some selector-fu.</li>
    <li>If using navbars, undo all the navbar collapsing and expanding behavior (this is too much to show here, so peep the example).</li>
  </ol>
  <p>You'll still need Respond.js for IE8 (since our media queries are still there and need to be picked up). This just disables the "mobile site" of the Arrow framework.</p>

    <h4>A second option for those who are using SASS</h4>
    <p>The above option for a static site works for those using the pre-complied this framework. However, if you are using <code>.sccs</code> files to generate your CSS, a better option is to create a static grid without keeping the heavy overhead of the fluid grid system. Read about <a href="../css/#grid-static">the static-grid option</a> and <a href="../examples/static-grid/">view the example</a> for more details.</p>
